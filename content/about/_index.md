I started working with laser cutters in the winter of 2017 and have been addicted to the endless possibilities and smell of buring wood ever since.  

The jewelry pieces I create are very fragile because of their lace-like structure so it is very important to keep them in low impact areas and avoid smashing them with heavy objects.
